the significant of meta utf-8.

Universal Compatibility: UTF-8 is capable of representing any Unicode character, making it suitable for encoding text in multiple languages and scripts.

Variable Length Encoding: UTF-8 uses a variable-length encoding scheme, where characters may occupy one to four bytes depending on their Unicode code point.

Backward Compatibility: UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, meaning that ASCII characters (0-127) are represented by a single byte in UTF-8.

Self-synchronization: UTF-8 is designed in such a way that it is easy to determine the start of each character sequence, facilitating parsing and manipulation of UTF-8 encoded text.

Efficiency: UTF-8 is space-efficient for representing characters in the ASCII range while still accommodating the entire Unicode character set.

Wide Adoption: UTF-8 is widely adopted and supported by various programming languages, web standards, and operating systems, making it the dominant character encoding on the internet.
